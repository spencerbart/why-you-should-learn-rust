# Why You Should Learn Rust

## It’s growing fast:
Rust grew over [50% in 2022](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages) and its expected to [double this year](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2022/#programming-languages). Its package manager, crates.io, had [more downloads in 2022](https://twitter.com/davidtolnay/status/1622665062161989635) (13.5 billion) then the previous 7+ years combined. It’s been the [most loved programming language](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) in the world for the past 7 years.

## It’s being used everywhere:
Massive projects written in Rust are emerging like Cloudflare’s [Pingora](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet/), the [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) JavaScript runtime, AWS’s Lambda runtime [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/), and so many [more](https://github.com/topics/rust). Tons of companies are using it in critical parts of their infrastructure like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/), [Discord](https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust), [Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/27/developer-tools/programming-languages-endorsed-for-server-side-use-at-meta), [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-cloudflare-images-in-rust-and-cloudflare-workers/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/blog/how-prime-video-updates-its-app-for-more-than-8-000-device-types), [NPM](https://www.rust-lang.org/static/pdfs/Rust-npm-Whitepaper.pdf), and [others](https://www.rust-lang.org/production/users).

## Why it’s so good:
There are three main categories where programming languages excel. #1 type and memory safety, #2 developer experience and ecosystem, and #3 performance.

- C and C++ have #3 as the main priority
- Java and C# have #1 as the main priority
- Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby have #2 as the main priority

- `Rust fits into all 3. Its type system is S tier, it’s memory safe, the developer experience is amazing, the developer ecosystem isn’t as matured as other languages but it’s extremely strong, and you can achieve near max theoretical performance.`
